# Visiting ARRL Headquarters

![Visiting ARRL Headquarters](../../img/w1aw-01.jpg)

My family was in New York for a wedding and we had a chance to visit the ARRL Headquarters in Newington, CT to see W1AW! We had a tour of the building and got to see the testing lab and all the departments at ARRL.

 Joe Garcia, the station manager at W1AW set me up to operate on one of their stations available. It was so overwhelming having all that power and antenna at my fingertips. I was able to squeak out a contact or two and then we hit the road for lunch.
