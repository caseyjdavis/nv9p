# ARRL Rookie Roundup 2015

![ARRL Rookie Roundup](../../img/arrl.jpg)


This was my very first attempt at contesting. I participated in the annual ARRL Rookie Roundup this year with the help of John Wells, KB0NE.

John was kind enough to share his shack with me and show me the basics of operating in a contest. I didn't score too many points but it was a great afternoon and got me thinking about how to contest more efficiently in the future.
