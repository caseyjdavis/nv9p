# Field Day 2016

![Field Day 2016](../../img/fieldday2016.jpg)

I operated at the Cabin in Pecos, New Mexico for Field Day 2016.

This was my first field day and I lumped it together with a family trip to the cabin so I didn't get much operating time. Between radio difficulties and band conditions I only managed 2 measely contacts all weekend. I used a Buddipole setup with my Icom 7200 HF radio with a tuner.
