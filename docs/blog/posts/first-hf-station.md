# First HF Station

![First HF Station](../../img/icom-746.jpg)

My first HF station, a used Icom-746 bought off Craigslist that came with an Astron SS-30M power supply. Word of advice, don't buy radios off Craigslist..

<!-- more -->

I messed with this radio for weeks not having good luck with contacting stations only to find out the transmitter was fried. It was only putting out about 3 watts of power. After having it repaired I sold it to buy a new Icom 7200 and had much better luck. Still it left a lasting mark because I spent so much time getting absolutely nowhere with making contacts.
