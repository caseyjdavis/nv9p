# About

My interest in amateur radio began in 2013 when I was living in Colorado Springs. I had no idea this whole other world of amateur radio existed and when I started to learn about it I knew I had to get involved. I studied for the Technician exam and found the exam was being offered at a local church. I went in one Saturday and passed both the Technician and General exam sessions and was given the callsign KE0BUI.

After a year of contacts and listening and a lot of studying I upgraded my license to Amateur Extra in Fort Collins and given the callsign AD0OW. I used mainly 2m and 70cm bands during this time with a Yaesu FT60R handi-talkie. I got to know the guys at the CSU Amateur Radio Club and learned a lot about repeaters. We overhauled the W0QEY repeater on the CSU campus for the first time in 30 years!

I requested a vanity callsign from the FCC and received the callsign NV9P on the 29th of May, 2015. I work the 40m and 20m bands on phone and PSK31. Lately I have been researching antenna options to expand my band capabilities and distance.
